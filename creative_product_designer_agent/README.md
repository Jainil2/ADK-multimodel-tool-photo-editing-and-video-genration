## What Can It Do?

### 1. Create New Product Photos

Just describe your product and where you want to show it, and the AI will create a professional photo for you.

**What you need to tell it:**

- **Your product** (required) - What is it? What does it look like?
  - Example: "handmade lavender soap with dried flowers"
  - Example: "ceramic coffee mug in navy blue"
  - Example: "organic honey in a glass jar"

- **The setting** (optional) - Where should your product be?
  - Example: "on a white background"
  - Example: "on a wooden table with natural light"
  - Example: "surrounded by fresh ingredients"
  - If you don't specify, it will use a nice clean background

**Simple Example:**

```
Product: handmade candle in a glass jar
Setting: clean white background
```

Result: You'll get a professional product photo!

### 2. Edit Existing Photos

Already have a photo but want to change something? You can make one change at a time.

**What you can change:**

- Background (e.g., "change background to white")
- Add items (e.g., "add flowers around the product")
- Lighting (e.g., "make it brighter")
- Remove items (e.g., "remove the cup from the background")
- Product color (e.g., "change color to blue")

**Simple Example:**

```
Change: add some fresh herbs around the product
```

**Need multiple changes?** No problem! Just do them one at a time.

### 3. Combine Multiple Products

Want to show multiple products together? You can combine several product photos into one!

**Perfect for:**

- Gift sets and product bundles
- Showing product variations (different colors/sizes)
- Before & after comparisons
- Product collections
- Family of products arranged together

**Simple Example:**

```
Products: [candle1.png, candle2.png, candle3.png]
What to do: arrange these three candles side by side on white background
```

Result: All three candles beautifully arranged in one photo!
